Classification of WhatsApp messages based on sentinel analysis (positive or negative messages) and per country.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) project.

For this AI model I used Naive Bayer Classifier model from NLTK library, pretrained existing model.
For preprocessing of data I removed URL, HTML, empty messages, still included stopwords to keep context.
Standardised all text using lowercase, then tokenization.
Did exploratory data analysis with matplotlib and seaborn libraries.


Codecademy NLP challenge project, data provided by Codecademy.
All messages are in English from various countries.

Possible users of the AI model: governments, law enforcement (identifying and tracking suspects as quite often they use social media apps), 
app developers (removing messages that don't follow guidelines), education (learn a new language based on online conversations).
